# code_champ

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
In this project we are trying to solve a common problem that we often face when doing competitive programming. we always think it would be great to be updated about the upcoming event realted to competitive programming both in offline and online. and it give you a opportunity to be connect we with other competitive programming aspirant and also track all their data. you can also create a club and add your friends in that and do group work...

so this is the basic idea about the app. we are doing this for our 3rd sem software development course...
